# inti-imgq-verifier
Image Verifier.

INTI was asked to develop a Software for image quality validation on the Biometric process for all the Banks in the country.
The task was to check the biometric images and use the NIST [NFIQ](http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/bio_quality.cfm) metric for it.

The first prototype developed intended to show the capability of INTI's Software LAB to quickly give response to the governmental of Social Security ([ANSES](www.anses.gob.ar)) requirements is uploaded here.

Using **Groovy/Grails** Framework technology and interacting simply with [NBIS](http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/nbis.cfm) Software.
